Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
Yes, all three models (AlexNet, ResNet, and VGG) classified the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg as Golden Retriever. So, there’s no difference in their breed classification for this image.

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
They did! Each model classified both Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as Golden Retriever.

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 
Yes, all three models correctly identified Cat_01.jpg and Car_01.jpg as not being dogs.

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
Honestly, all three models did pretty much the same job with these images. They all correctly identified dogs and non-dogs but missed the breed classification. If I had to choose based on performance speed, AlexNet would be the winner because it’s the quickest of the three. It took just 1 second, while ResNet took 2 seconds and VGG took a bit longer at 9 seconds. So, if speed is what you're looking for, AlexNet is your best bet!
